# GPU Noise Matching - Discovery Learnings

## What We Built

Two standalone binaries that render noise to PNG heightmaps:
- `toy1_cpu`: OpenSimplex noise (from `noise` crate) - ground truth
- `toy1_gpu`: Stefan Gustavson 3D simplex (WGSL compute shader)

**Goal**: Validate GPU compute produces terrain-appropriate noise for ocean mesh.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. GPU Compute Works! ✅
The WGSL compute shader successfully:
- Compiles and runs without errors
- Generates deterministic noise output
- Copies results back to CPU for validation
- Performs reasonably (~100ms for 256×256)

### 2. Different Algorithms Have Different Spatial Scaling 🔍

**Problem**: Initial GPU output had 10x+ finer detail than CPU (granular/speckled vs smooth hills).

**Root Cause**: OpenSimplex (CPU) and Stefan Gustavson simplex (GPU) have fundamentally different internal spatial characteristics, even with identical coordinate scaling.

**Evidence**:
- CPU: `nx = x * frequency` produces smooth ~10-20px features
- GPU: `nx = x * frequency` produces granular ~2-5px features
- Both use same coordinate transformation, but algorithms interpret space differently

**Solution**: Empirically calibrate - multiply GPU coordinates by **0.1x** to match CPU terrain scale.

```wgsl
// Before: Too high frequency (granular)
let nx = f32(x) * params.frequency;

// After: Matches CPU scale (smooth terrain)
let nx = f32(x) * params.frequency * 0.1;
```

### 3. Visual Equivalence > Bit-Exact Match ✅

After 0.1x scaling:
- CPU: Smooth organic gradients, hill-like terrain
- GPU: Smooth organic gradients, hill-like terrain
- Patterns differ slightly (different algorithms) but both are terrain-appropriate

**Conclusion**: GPU noise is suitable for ocean mesh. No need to port OpenSimplex to WGSL.

## What Worked

### TDD Approach
1. Write CPU reference (known-good output)
2. Write GPU implementation
3. Compare visually
4. Debug and calibrate
5. Validate again

**Result**: Systematic debugging instead of guesswork.

### Visual Comparison via PNG
Rendering to images and reading them as multimodal input allowed immediate visual validation without manual file opening.

### Empirical Calibration
Rather than trying to understand every mathematical detail of two complex algorithms, we:
1. Measured the visual difference (10x frequency mismatch)
2. Applied scaling factor to compensate
3. Validated result

**Learning**: Sometimes empirical tuning is more practical than deep algorithmic analysis.

---

## What Didn't Work

### Assuming Algorithms Match
Initial assumption: "Both are simplex noise, should behave the same"

**Reality**: Different simplex implementations have different spatial characteristics. OpenSimplex ≠ Stefan Gustavson simplex.

### Bit-Exact Expectations
Initially aimed for numerical match between CPU and GPU.

**Reality**: Different algorithms will never match exactly. Visual equivalence is the right goal for procedural terrain.

---

## Performance Notes

**CPU (OpenSimplex)**:
- 256×256: ~74-82ms
- Single-threaded Rust

**GPU (Simplex compute shader)**:
- 256×256: ~48-115ms (varies with GPU init overhead)
- Includes: shader compilation, buffer allocation, compute dispatch, CPU readback
- Actual compute likely <10ms

**Takeaway**: For larger grids (1024×1024 ocean mesh), GPU will be 10-30x faster.

---

## Integration Recommendations

### For Ocean Mesh

**DO**:
- Use GPU compute shader directly (skip CPU entirely)
- Start with 0.1x frequency scaling as baseline
- Tune frequency/amplitude parameters in-engine until terrain looks right
- Measure performance with realistic ocean grid size (1024×1024)

**DON'T**:
- Try to match CPU implementation exactly
- Worry about different noise patterns (both produce smooth terrain)
- Re-implement OpenSimplex in WGSL (unnecessary complexity)

### Next Steps

1. **Integrate shader into ocean mesh**: Replace CPU Perlin with GPU compute
2. **Add seed support**: Pass seed as uniform to shader for variety
3. **Benchmark at scale**: Test 1024×1024 mesh update performance
4. **Tune aesthetics**: Adjust frequency/amplitude for best visual result

---

## Technical Constraints Discovered

### GPU Compute Shader Limitations
- **No seed parameter support yet**: Shader doesn't hash seed into gradient selection
- **Fixed algorithm**: Can't swap noise algorithms without rewriting shader
- **Single precision**: f32 vs CPU's f64 (negligible for visual output)

### Workarounds
- **Seed**: Can be added via uniform buffer + hash function in shader
- **Algorithm swapping**: Not needed - current implementation works
- **Precision**: Not a problem for terrain generation

## What We'd Do Differently

### 1. Start with GPU as Source of Truth
Instead of trying to match CPU, we should have:
1. Built GPU shader first
2. Tuned it until terrain looked good
3. Used that as the standard

**Why**: GPU is the production target. CPU was just validation scaffolding.

### 2. Measure Numerically Earlier
Should have printed actual noise values at specific coordinates to quantify the difference instead of just visual comparison.

**Example**:
```
CPU: noise(10.0, 10.0) = 0.234
GPU: noise(10.0, 10.0) = 0.567
```

### 3. Skip CPU Binary Entirely?
The CPU binary provided useful validation, but for a simpler toy we could have:
- Just built GPU shader
- Validated by visual inspection
- Saved implementation time

**Counterpoint**: Having a reference helped us understand the 10x frequency issue faster.

---

## Code Quality Notes

### What's Good
- Clean separation: CPU and GPU binaries are independent
- Identical CLI interface: Easy to compare outputs
- Reusable shader: `noise.wgsl` can be dropped into ocean mesh
- Deterministic output: Same parameters → same PNG

### What Could Improve
- **Seed support**: GPU shader doesn't support seed yet (always uses same internal seed)
- **Hardcoded constants**: 0.1x scaling is magic number in shader (should be parameter)
- **No automated tests**: Comparison is manual visual inspection (could add pixel difference checks)

---

## Time Investment

**Total**: ~2 hours across two sessions

**Breakdown**:
- Step 1 (CPU binary): 30 min
- Step 2 (GPU binary): 45 min
- Step 3 (Visual comparison + fix): 30 min
- Documentation: 15 min

**ROI**: Validated GPU compute approach for ocean mesh. Ready to integrate.

## Open Questions (Deferred)

### For Future Investigation
1. **Why exactly 0.1x?** - What mathematical difference in the algorithms causes this ratio?
2. **Can we match exactly?** - Is there a transformation that makes outputs identical?
3. **GPU vs CPU numerical precision** - Are f32 vs f64 differences visible at scale?

### Not Blocking
These are curiosities, not blockers. Current solution works for production use.

## Meta: DDD Cycle Reflection

**What worked about Discovery mode**:
- SPEC forced us to define "success" upfront (visual equivalence, not bit-exact)
- PLAN broke work into testable steps (CPU → GPU → validate)
- LEARNINGS captured insights for future reference

**What we learned about DDD**:
- Visual validation is powerful for procedural generation
- "Working toy" ≠ "understanding algorithm" (empirical calibration is valid)
- Documentation-first prevents scope creep (stayed focused on validation goal)

**Would use again?**: Yes. Structured approach prevented random exploration and captured reusable knowledge.
