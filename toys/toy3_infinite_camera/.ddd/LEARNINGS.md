# Toy Model 3: Toroidal Camera Navigation – Learnings

Duration: 1 session | Status: Complete | Estimate: 4 hours

## Summary

**Built:** Toroidal camera navigation with 360° free movement on infinite wrapping terrain
**Worked:** Proper toroidal wrapping math, velocity-based camera, keyboard controls, refactored infrastructure
**Failed:** Initial buffer alignment (80 bytes, not 56/64/72/76) - toy2 lesson not applied upfront
**Uncertain:** Whether simplified PLAN approach (4 steps vs 10) scales to more complex features

## Evidence

### ✅ Validated: Toroidal Wrapping Math

**Approach:**
```wgsl
// Wrap camera to torus space (modulo)
let camera_torus_x = camera_pos.x - floor(camera_pos.x / torus_extent_x) * torus_extent_x;

// Calculate nearest distance on torus
var dx = local_x - camera_torus_x;
if (dx > half_extent_x) { dx -= torus_extent_x; }
if (dx < -half_extent_x) { dx += torus_extent_x; }

// Noise sampled at unwrapped world coordinates
let world_x = camera_pos.x + dx;
```

**Result:**
- Vertices positioned at nearest distance from camera (no phantom lines)
- Noise coherence maintained across torus boundaries (same world pos = same height)
- Works for any camera velocity vector (forward, diagonal, circular, stopped)

**Performance:** 120 FPS at 512×512 grid (2× target of 60 FPS)

**Conclusion:** Toroidal wrapping on GPU with camera-relative positioning is viable and performant.

### ✅ Validated: Infrastructure Refactoring

**Refactorings applied before implementation:**

1. **CameraState struct** (lib.rs:22-53)
   - Encapsulates position, velocity, delta time tracking
   - `update()` method handles automatic position updates
   - Reduced 10-step plan to 4 steps

2. **TerrainParams::new()** (lib.rs:83-106)
   - Constructor with sensible defaults
   - Auto-calculates torus_extent from grid params
   - `with_audio()` for easy modulation

3. **Camera-relative matrix** (lib.rs:87-108)
   - Camera at origin (0, 80, 0) looking forward
   - Vertices already camera-relative from compute shader
   - Removed unused `camera_z` parameter

**Impact:** Reduced implementation from 10 steps to 4 steps (~60% reduction)

**Conclusion:** Proactive refactoring before implementation is highly effective for DDD workflows.

### ⚠️ Challenged: WGSL Uniform Buffer Alignment

**Problem:** Buffer size mismatch - Rust struct vs WGSL expectations

**Iterations:**
- Attempt 1: 56 bytes (Rust) vs 64 bytes (WGSL expected)
- Attempt 2: 64 bytes → WGSL wanted 80 bytes
- Attempt 3: 72 bytes → Still wanted 80 bytes
- Attempt 4: 76 bytes → Still wanted 80 bytes
- **Final:** 80 bytes (7 extra f32 padding fields)

**Root cause:**
- WGSL aligns uniform buffer structs to 16-byte boundaries
- Final vec4 padding requires additional alignment
- Rust `#[repr(C)]` layout != WGSL uniform buffer layout

**Lesson from toy2 NOT applied upfront:**
- Toy2 LEARNINGS.md documented this exact issue (32-byte Vertex alignment)
- We missed applying it to TerrainParams initially
- Cost: ~5 debugging iterations

**Correct pattern:**
```rust
#[repr(C)]
struct TerrainParams {
    // ... fields totaling 52 bytes
    pub _padding2: f32,
    pub _padding3: f32,
    pub _padding4: f32,
    pub _padding5: f32,
    pub _padding6: f32,
    pub _padding7: f32,
    pub _padding8: f32,  // Total: 80 bytes
}
```

**Conclusion:** WGSL uniform buffer alignment is non-obvious. Always validate with GPU errors, then add padding to match. Document size calculation in comments.

### ✅ Validated: Keyboard Control Pattern

**Implemented modes:**
- **'1'**: Forward (10 m/s)
- **'2'**: Diagonal northeast (~10 m/s)
- **'Space'**: Stop/resume toggle
- **'3'**: Circular orbit (200m radius, 60s period)
- **'P'**: FPS summary

**Pattern:**
```rust
enum MotionMode { Forward, Diagonal, Stopped, Circular }

// In render():
if motion_mode == Circular {
    // Update position directly for smooth circular motion
    camera.position = calculate_circle_point(time, radius, period);
    camera.set_velocity(tangent_velocity);
} else {
    camera.update();  // Normal velocity-based
}
```

**Result:** Clean separation of motion logic, easy to test different patterns

**Conclusion:** MotionMode enum + conditional update works well for toy testing. For main game, will need physics-based approach.

## Pivots

**Original toy2 PLAN:** 9 steps with visual validation checkpoints
**Toy3 approach:** 4 steps after upfront refactoring
**Why:** Refactoring (CameraState, TerrainParams helpers) eliminated redundant steps
**What remains:** Validate this scales to more complex features (not just grid demos)

## Impact

### Reusable Patterns

1. **Toroidal wrapping shader code** (terrain_compute.wgsl:130-169)
   - Copy to main codebase terrain compute shader
   - Proven to work for 360° navigation
   - Performance validated at production scale

2. **CameraState pattern** (lib.rs:22-53)
   - Reference for main player camera controls
   - Velocity-based update with delta time
   - Clean abstraction for position/velocity management

3. **TerrainParams builder** (lib.rs:83-106)
   - Pattern for parameter structs with defaults
   - Fluent API (`with_audio()`) for modulation
   - Auto-calculation of derived values (torus extents)

### Architectural Consequences

**For main vibesurfer integration:**

1. **GPU terrain generation:** ✅ Validated at 120 FPS (2× target)
   - Move terrain generation to GPU compute shader
   - 512×512 grid is performant, can scale to 1024×1024

2. **Toroidal navigation:** ✅ Proven approach
   - Use camera-relative positioning
   - Wrap camera position to torus space
   - Sample noise at unwrapped world coordinates
   - No CPU grid management needed (pure GPU)

3. **Player controls foundation:** ✅ Camera abstraction ready
   - `CameraState` provides velocity-based positioning
   - Extend with physics (acceleration, banking, collision)
   - Motion modes (forward, diagonal, circular) all working

4. **Buffer alignment awareness:** ⚠️ Critical for all GPU structs
   - Document WGSL size requirements in struct comments
   - Validate early with test runs (don't assume Rust size matches)
   - Consider helper macro for auto-padding calculation

### Estimate Calibration

**Original estimate:** 4 hours (PLAN after refactoring)
**Actual time:** ~3-4 hours (implementation + alignment debugging)
**Breakdown:**
- Refactoring: 30 min (high value - eliminated 6 steps)
- Step 1-3 implementation: 45 min (fast due to refactoring)
- Alignment debugging: 1.5-2 hours (should have been 15 min if we applied toy2 learning)
- Testing/validation: 30 min

**Calibration:**
- Refactoring upfront was highly effective (60% step reduction)
- Alignment debugging was avoidable (toy2 lesson missed)
- **Adjusted estimate for similar work:** 2-3 hours if learnings applied

## Recommendations for Future Work

### Immediate (Main Codebase Integration)

1. **Copy toroidal wrapping shader code**
   - Replace any existing terrain generation with compute shader approach
   - Use toy3 wrapping math (proven correct)
   - Expected result: 60+ FPS at current grid size, 2× headroom

2. **Adopt CameraState pattern for player camera**
   - Start with velocity-based positioning
   - Add physics layer (acceleration, drag, banking) on top
   - Keep toroidal wrapping logic in GPU (no CPU grid flow)

3. **Document buffer alignment requirements**
   - Create helper comments for all GPU structs
   - Example: `// WGSL size: 80 bytes (56 data + 24 padding)`
   - Consider build-time validation (const assert on struct sizes)

### Process Improvements

1. **Apply prior toy learnings BEFORE implementation**
   - Read previous toy LEARNINGS.md before starting new toy
   - Alignment was documented in toy2, should have been applied upfront
   - Create checklist of common GPU pitfalls (alignment, binding, etc.)

2. **Refactor-first approach worked well**
   - Extracting abstractions (CameraState, TerrainParams) before coding saved time
   - Reduced 10 steps to 4 steps
   - Continue this pattern for future toys

3. **Keyboard testing pattern is effective**
   - Multiple motion modes exercised the toroidal wrapping thoroughly
   - Quick iteration without rebuilding
   - Keep for future GPU work (shader debugging, parameter tuning)

### ⚠️ Challenged: Toroidal Wrapping Implementation (Post-Session Discovery)

**Problem:** Initial implementation had terrain oscillating and only rendering on half the screen

**Root causes identified:**
1. **Compute shader had broken wrapping logic** - Tried to position vertices camera-relative, creating discontinuities
2. **Camera target wrapping was naive** - Wrapped target position independently, breaking look_at direction across seam
3. **Index buffer didn't wrap toroidally** - Grid edges weren't connected, creating visible boundaries
4. **Vertex shader didn't handle wrapping** - Critical: vertices must be repositioned relative to camera in render shader

**The fix (4-part solution):**

1. **Simplified compute shader** (terrain_compute.wgsl:132-152)
   - Fixed terrain at torus positions (0-512m)
   - Sample noise at fixed positions (creates repeating pattern every 512m - acceptable for toy)
   - No camera-dependent positioning in compute

2. **Fixed camera look direction** (lib.rs:139-142)
   - Use direction vector instead of wrapped target position
   - Prevents camera from "looking backward" when crossing seam
   - `forward = Vec3::new(0.0, -60.0, 300.0).normalize()`

3. **Toroidal index buffer** (lib.rs:159-186)
   - Wrap grid indices: `(x + 1) % grid_size` and `(z + 1) % grid_size`
   - Connects edges seamlessly (last column → first column, etc.)
   - Creates true toroidal topology

4. **Vertex shader wrapping** (terrain_render.wgsl:26-43) **← CRITICAL**
   - Wrap camera position to torus space
   - Calculate nearest-distance offset for each vertex (handles seam crossing)
   - Transform to unwrapped world position before projection
   - This creates the "infinite ocean" effect - terrain visible across entire viewport

**Result:**
- ✅ Full-screen seamless terrain rendering
- ✅ No visible seams at any camera position (tested 0-1000m)
- ✅ Smooth continuous motion
- ✅ Terrain pattern repeats every 512m (acceptable trade-off)

**Key insight:** For toroidal wrapping to work visually, **the vertex shader must reposition geometry relative to the camera**. The compute shader just creates the base geometry - the magic happens in the render pass.

**Performance:** No measurable impact - wrapping logic is simple modulo arithmetic per vertex

**Lesson:** Toroidal wrapping for infinite terrain requires coordination across THREE layers:
1. Compute shader: Generate fixed torus geometry
2. Index buffer: Connect edges toroidally
3. Vertex shader: Position vertices relative to wrapped camera (the critical piece!)

## Meta-Learning (DDD Process)

**What worked:**
- Refactoring before implementation (60% step reduction)
- Simplified 4-step PLAN (easy to execute, clear milestones)
- Keyboard controls for rapid testing (no rebuild needed)
- Committing after each step (clean history, easy debugging)

**What didn't work:**
- Not applying toy2 buffer alignment learning upfront (cost 1.5 hours)
- Should have read toy2 LEARNINGS.md before starting

**DDD improvement:**
- **Before starting CODE phase:** Read all prior toy LEARNINGS.md files
- Create "Known GPU Pitfalls" checklist (alignment, bindings, synchronization)
- Refactor-first approach should be standard for toys (not optional)
